We have devices ranging from a 2 inch display to 42 inches and every other dimension in between. Designing a UI that fits well with all or most device is a challenge. Even when we create an app with responsive design principles in mind we do stumble upon a lot of issues while trying to give the best User experience. </p>\n<p>One such problem is with identifying high resolution devices with smaller screen sizes. In such devices it becomes even more difficult to identify the best strategy to take advantage of high resolution and yet be careful of not trying to stuff in more than the user can interact with. Another issue is with handling responsiveness on Single Page Apps. Most SPAs demand that the whole page be visible on the screen which becomes a challenge on Tablets due to smaller screen sizes. Adding scroll bars impacts UX in such cases.</p>\n<p>In my talk I will talk from my experience of the various problem we face while desigining a responsive web app. We will spend some time on discussing approaches to solve issues with displaying an SPA page on different device screens. We will look at how we can take advantage of HTML5 features and try some smart code to solve a lot of concerns with responsive designs.</p>",

Good performance in this programming model is feasible because of a key design tenet of React called <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reconciliation.html\">DOM Reconciliation</a>. In short, React does not mutate or create the <em>actual</em> DOM (for that is expensive and full of peril), instead it creates a representation of the DOM (which is called the <em>Virtual DOM</em>) at every app state, and then applies <em>only the differences</em> that need to be applied to the actual DOM.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we will explore what designing and programming UIs with such a <em>Virtual DOM</em> representation entails. We extend the Virtual DOM idea to the server-side and represent complex UIs as denotations tied to their <a href=\"http://webcomponents.org/\">Web Component</a> counterparts. This combination makes it easy to compose data-driven UIs from smaller reusable parts. We will also see examples of these ideas manifesting in the <a href=\"http://elm-lang.org\">Elm</a> ecosystem and some Julia UI packages (namely <a href=\"https://github.com/JuliaLang/Interact.jl\">Interact</a>, <a href=\"http://github.com/shashi/Patchwork.jl\">Patchwork</a>, and <a href=\"http://github.com/shashi/Canvas.jl\">Canvas</a>)</p>\n<p>Agenda/Contents:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are Values?<ul>\n<li>Numerals as the UI of numbers</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>UIs as abstract values<ul>\n<li>Rendering abstract values into Virtual DOM</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Functionally Composing UIs<ul>\n<li>An algebra of layouts (aka try this with HTML)</li>\n<li>Style and theming</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Reactive programming: Interaction and Animations<ul>\n<li>UI as a time-varying value</li>\n<li>Diffing and Patching</li>\n<li>The case for the server sending patches to the browser</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Making UIs at a REPL</li>\n<li>Debugging: Time-travel and infinite undo</li>\n</ul>",

Designers frown upon the developers&rsquo; inability to design what they did in their graphic software. Developers blames the designers for being creative for the wrong reason.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s dive into some ideas, principles and naturally occurring phenomenon to help both designers and developers and apply to their work to bring forth better designs, creatively apply repetitive patterns and make their work beautiful.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s learn to look at the beauty of nature, sacred mathematical fractals and algorithms to design our products, apps, websites, mobile apps and your life.</p>\n<h2>Problem</h2>\n<p>With most designs projects - be it a website, or an app - has never been easy to make a client and everyone involved be really happy.</p>\n<p>A visual designer may do her best and get the clients convinced somehow, the final design usually loses its edge and originality when translated to the web, and devices.</p>\n<p>It is not easy and a tedious process to keep the Typography consistent, the spacing - paddings, margins - in sync.</p>\n<h2>Presentation Preview</h2>\n<p>The presentation will highlight some of the natural existing solutions to design problems - the Golden Ratio, the Fibonacci Sequence, the Cicada Principle - and how they can be used to leverage product designs - for the web, and devices.</p>\n<p>There will also be references to musical notes - the minor, major, fourth, sixth, octave, tenth, etc - and apply it to design to achieve a modular scale with the typography, and spacings between elements to bring forth a design that has its meanings.</p>\n<p>There will mentions of how adapting these principles, mathematical fractals can bring beauty, consistency and a sense of being part of users when it comes to designs that they interact everyday.</p>\n<h2>Takeaway from the Presentation</h2>\n<p>The presentation will walk through some of the well known naturally occurring phenomenon, patterns and mathematical fractals.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll also prepare an open source example complete with working code on how we can apply such patterns, fractals to help designers and non-designers (read developers) understand each other better and be able to bring out design works that are ingrained in the beauty of nature.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, the presentation should be able to help inculcate a thinking into new designers and those who work with designers be able to take decisions with their work to make it more &lsquo;beautiful&rsquo;.</p>",

Build apps whose content can be magically reconfigured from the server.<br>\n2. Define the content and layout for the apps once and have it work on all the different platforms.<br>\n3. An easy interface to be able to define such content and layout.<br>\n4. The ability to travel faster than light.</p>\n<p>We have attempted solutions to the first three things, and would like to share them with you. (Meanwhile feel free to attempt the fourth.) It&rsquo;s like Photoshop for building app content in the age of mobile platforms. Upvote the proposal and come hear the full story.</p>",

The larger the framework is, like Angular and Ember, the more performance penalties they incur (4 and 5 seconds).</p>\n<p>Isomorphic Javascript is a technique to minimize the perceived performance penalties for the end user, by rendering your page on the server using Node/IO, and serving the static HTML generated. This significantly decreases the time to first render, which effectively speeds up the site drastically for the end user. The framework will then be loaded asynchronously, and will take over once loaded to provide the interactivity. </p>\n<p><strong>Advantages</strong><br>\n1. This technique is especially useful in mobile devices, as seen from the analysis, where 3G speeds can cause ~5 seconds delay to the render time.<br>\n2. SEO benefits just like a server-sided app.<br>\n3. Progressive enhancement of the site, so the content loads first, and then is made interactive.  </p>\n<p>Considering this is MetaRefresh and not JSFoo, I&rsquo;ll be talking about this technique in general, talking about the various advantages in detail, along with the tradeoffs required to build this into your app. However, as for implementation details, I&rsquo;ll be talking from the context of <a href=\"http://emberjs.com/blog/2014/12/22/inside-fastboot-the-road-to-server-side-rendering.html\">Ember &amp; Fastboot</a>, <a href=\"http://dev.alexishevia.com/2014/08/isomorphic-apps-with-backbonejs-and.html\">Backbone &amp; React</a>, and <a href=\"https://prerender.io/\">Prerender.io</a>. </p>\n<p>Note that the <a href=\"https://www.meteor.com/\">Meteor Framework</a> is one of the most famous examples of Isomorphic Javascript.

A statement from the book <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22022723-sketching-user-experiences?from_search=true\">&ldquo;Sketching User Experiences&rdquo;</a> by Bill Buxton says - &ldquo;Time spent developing a technique provides the foundation for the creation of the art.&rdquo;. In this case techniques are the many strategies designers and developers have already worked on while designing for the mobile ecosystem. Understanding what they have done will give us an insight of what works and what doesn&rsquo;t so that we can ourself create a unique solution.</p>\n<p>Specifically in this discussion we are looking at patterns where the challenge is to visualise content. There&rsquo;s a common pattern with any system that has the basic job of visualising a lot of content and it hasn&rsquo;t changed much with time. Three type of models are chosen and any interface has the challenge to visualise all these three.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Representing the list of items.  </li>\n<li>A categorization of the items where we have different groups of articles.  </li>\n<li>The actual item itselft which is the eventual purpose.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A simple example of this pattern being used, is in publications which has a list of articles categorised on different themes. It needs to showcase the list of articles, the different themes (tech, science, sports etc) on which articles are grouped and the article itself.</p>\n<p>Each model above is unique and present its own challenges especially for mobile. We&rsquo;ll first discuss the significance itself of each model and then lot of real life examples that have tried to solve them.<br>\nFor instance, categorization which also serves as navigation for the app, has lot of patterns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The left nav flyout menu.</li>\n<li>Top navigation or do nothing.</li>\n<li>Full screen menu</li>\n<li>Carousel+.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is also important to measure and analyse each pattern on the yardsticks of good design. That will help us understand what problems is each pattern solving and as such their true purpose. Some of the points include but not limited to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The importance of whitespace and boundaries in design.</li>\n<li>User attention span.</li>\n<li>Utilising touch gestures effectively.</li>\n<li>The case of design discovery.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every designer is working in a unique context and set of constraints in which they are trying to represent their content model. Learning about these patterns will help him/her objectively analyse what all things he should take care of design wise, so that he can give the best fit solution.</p>",
